TIDY_SET.txt
This set contains data collected from the UCI Human Activity Recognition From Smartphones Archive. 
The Test and Training Data sets have been combined , along with their Subject counter parts and apporpriate field names.

Each record has the mean and standard deviation values for following fields
Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
Its activity label. 
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The labels have been adjusted to allow for valid use in R. ActivityLabel and Subject have been converted to Factor variables and 
the Activities have been labeled with their full desecriptions.
